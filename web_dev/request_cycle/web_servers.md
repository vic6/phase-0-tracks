Unlike windows and mac, Linux assumes the user is computer literate and does not shield the user from complexity. This gives the user more control over the system. The CLI of Linux is not hidden away, and gives no feedback when performing potentiality dangerous operations.

A virtual private server is a server hosted on a remote computer. It is cheaper to use than a physical server and can easily be created and configured.
