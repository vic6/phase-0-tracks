I think I will first search for a jQuery cheat cheat just to get a scope of content in jQuery. Then I plan to search for a tutorial that explains the basics. I can learn at a quicker pace when I am able to see how something is done step by step and then am given the change to apply that knowledge on a similar but different example. I try to apply the pomodoro technique and work for 25 min with 5 min rests.
