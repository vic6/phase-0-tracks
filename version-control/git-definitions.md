# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    - Version control records changes to software and keeps the files well organized. It allows a developer to revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.
    
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    - A branch is a unique series of code changes with a unique name. It allows a developer to copy and make changes to files from the master branch without actually changing the master branch. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    - A commit records changes made to the repository. A good commit message is detailed and describes the changes made.

* What is a merge conflict?
    - A merge conflict occurs when the current branch and the branch being merged into have diverged. For example, if the current branch has modified a string of text, but the master branch deleted the text that was to be modified, a merge conflict will occur when a merge is attempted.
